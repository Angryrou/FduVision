an AR Demo. <br>
This is a project named "复旦印象" @ChenxiStudio Fdu. Chenxi Studio is a lovely group with many helpful and friendly friends in Fudan University.<br>
The first iOS version of "复旦印象" is from Wu Dong, an excellent developer. For me, he is like a mentor, a patient teacher waiting for answering all of your questions about iOS, and at most time, a nice friend and our basketball teammate.<br>

This was an old project, my first iOS application, which always means a lot for me. However, limited by me early day ability, I didn't finish it using my own algorithm. Luckily, using the demo from EasyAR 1.3, I finally somehow made a runnable application at the end of 2016. <br>
I always regard the project as my own child and have tried my best to finish this. I have no regrets on this. <br>
By the way, the unity demo from EasyAR works even better, so maybe my version may not be used by lots of Fudaners. Maybe it's the only pity for me. <br>
